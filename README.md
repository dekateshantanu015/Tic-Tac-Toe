# Tic-Tac-Toe

The Hero vs. Villain Tic Tac Toe project introduces a thematic twist to the classic game, pitting iconic heroes against notorious villains in an epic battle of wits. Players will have the option to choose a side, either heroes or villains. The game will follow traditional Tic Tac Toe rules, but with thematic elements woven throughout, such as custom-designed game boards featuring hero-themed or villain-themed aesthetics. The objective is to create a fun and immersive gaming experience that combines the timeless appeal of Tic Tac Toe with the thrilling clash between heroes and villains.
